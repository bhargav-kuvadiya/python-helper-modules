# JSON to CSV Converter

This is a Python script that allows you to convert JSON data into a CSV format. It's particularly useful when dealing with nested JSON structures and allows for optional field mapping.

## Usage

### Requirements

To use this script, you'll need Python 3.x and the pandas library installed. You can install pandas using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

### Running the Script

You can run the script from the command line with the following command:

```bash
python json_to_csv_converter.py
```

This will convert the `input.json` file to `output.csv` using the default field mapping.

### Custom Field Mapping

You can also specify a custom field mapping using a dictionary. For example, if you want to map JSON keys to different CSV column names, you can do so like this:

```python
mapping = {'Name': 'full_name', 'Email': 'contact.email', 'Phone': 'contact.phone'}
convert(input_json_file, output_csv_file, field_mapping=mapping)
```

This will use the custom field mapping to create the CSV.

## Input and Output Files

- `input.json`: This is the input JSON file you want to convert to CSV. Make sure to place your JSON data in this file.

- `output.csv`: This is the resulting CSV file where the converted data will be saved.

## Error Handling

The script includes error handling for cases where the input JSON file is not found or if there's an issue with the JSON format. If any errors occur during the conversion process, you will receive an error message specifying the issue.
